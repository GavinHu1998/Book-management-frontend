# 📚 Library Management SPA — Project Proposal

## 1. Project Overview  
This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with **React**, designed for managing a digital library. It provides users with functionalities to browse, search, add, edit, and delete books through a user-friendly interface. Role-based access control is implemented to ensure that only administrators can perform sensitive actions.
